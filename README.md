# Starbucks Locations Worldwide 2021 Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to the data exploration of Starbucks locations around the globe. This project, rooted in the datasets from Kaggle and guided by educational content from Brilliant.org, is aimed at extracting meaningful insights from the geographical spread and density of Starbucks stores worldwide.

## Datasets
This analysis uses two primary datasets:
1. [Starbucks Locations Worldwide 2021 Version](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kukuroo3/starbucks-locations-worldwide-2021-version)
2. [Starbucks Store Locations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starbucks/store-locations)

Both datasets provide extensive details about Starbucks stores, which serve as the foundation for our analytics.

## Goals
The main goal of this project is to transform raw data into actionable insights. By applying techniques learned through [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/) series, we strive to:
- Analyze the distribution of stores across different regions.
- Understand the market penetration in various countries.
- Identify patterns related to store locations and their proximity to certain landmarks or city centers.

## Methodology
Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we have conducted a thorough analysis that involves:
- Data Cleaning: Preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values and incorrect entries.
- Data Transformation: Converting data into a consistent format for accurate comparison and analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using statistical methods and visualization tools to uncover underlying patterns and trends.
- Interpretation: Drawing conclusions from our findings to provide recommendations and insights.

## Repository Structure
- `Analysis Jupyter Notebook.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing all the analysis work and commentary.
- `data`: Directory containing the datasets used in this analysis.

## Conclusions
We present our findings in a clear and accessible manner, with visualizations that highlight the most interesting and informative results of our exploration.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the `Analysis Jupyter Notebook.ipynb` to see the analysis process and results.
